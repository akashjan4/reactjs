Introduction


Virtual DOM
- Model give data to UI and UI add that the Data to UI
```
{
    name:'Apple',
    color:'red'
} 
<div>Apple</div>
<div>red</div>
```
Now if you have to update the name you have to write JS code to update the div which have 'name' value
and similarly, if you have to update 'color', you have keep track of div which contain 'color' value

- Similarly more the value in model, more the chances of model update. These update can be non-sequential. So, we have to keep track of all the elements which require update and have to do lot of expensive DOM manipulation. Result, low performance and lot of code to manage.

- **To avoid costly DOM manipulation or View Updates, React keep first snapshot of DOM/View. Whenever 
model updates -> view paints the whole information
React compare the newly painted view with the Snapshot it have and just render the changes.
This is Virtual DOM**  


## Web-components
 - Create reusable custom html elements
 - Functional Components
 

 ## Setup
 - Pre-requisite - ES6
 - ``` 
    npm i react
    npm i react-dom
    npm i typescript -D
    npm i parcel-bundler -D
    npm i -D @types/react @types/react-dom
    ```
- package.json - (to run our bundler)
 ```javascript
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "parcel src/index.html"
  } 
 ```
# Folder structure

# index.html
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

    <div id="main"></div>
    <script src="./app.tsx"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
# app.tsx
```Typescript
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDom from "react-dom";

import HelloWorld from "./components/helloWorld";

ReactDom.render(<HelloWorld/>,  document.getElementById('main'))

```
# helloWorld.tsx
```Typescript
import * as React from 'react';

export default class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
    render(){
        return(<h1>Hello World! üôèüèª</h1>)
    }
}
```
